variables and types:
indentation: 4 spaces
strings: '' or "" or """
Identifiers: group of both the letters and digits, but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.
Case sensitive
Efficent memory management, by reusing the exsisting value in the memory.
id() -> uniqiue id of the object


Data Types:
Interpreter infers the type from the assigned value.
type() -> gives variable type

Primitive:
int ( no restrictions on the length )
float ( accurate upto 15decimal points. )
Complex numbers ( 1+2j )
str
Boolean

Advanced:
List ( heterogenous array [] )
Tuple ( heterogenous array (), It is a read-only data structure as we can't modify the size and value of the items.)
Dictonary ( d = {1:'Jimmy', 2:'Alex', 3:'john', 4:'mike'})
Set (Set is the unordered collection. It is iterable, mutable, and has unique elements.
In set, the order of the elements is undefined; it may return the changed sequence of the element. 
The set is created by using a built-in function set(), or a sequence of elements is passed in the curly braces and
separated by the comma. It can contain various types of values.)
set1 = set()  
or
set2 = {'James', 2, 3,'Python'}  
  
#Printing Set value  
print(set2)  
  
# Adding element to the set  
  
set2.add(10)  
print(set2)  
  
#Removing element from the set  
set2.remove(2)  
print(set2)  

output:
{3, 'Python', 'James', 2}
{'Python', 'James', 3, 2, 10}
{'Python', 'James', 3, 10}
